# WhiteLabel — Allowed Components & Theming Rules

## 🧩 Purpose
These rules strictly define how Builder.io AI may use the **White Label UI library**.  
They ensure that every generated layout uses only official components and theme tokens.

---

## ✅ Allowed Components
- Import **only** from: `@dejstdm/white-label-ui`
- Use only components exported in that package (`/dist`).
- Never create, rename, or invent components or props.

If a user requests a component that does not exist in `@dejstdm/white-label-ui`,  
**respond exactly with this message**:

> "Thanks for the idea! We don’t have that component in our White Label UI library yet.  
> We can add it to the backlog, or you can choose an existing component instead."

---

## 🎨 Theming Rules
- The only allowed theming source is `/app/theme.css`.
- Visual customization must come **only** from:
  1. Changing White Label variables in `/app/theme.css`
  2. Adjusting existing component props or variants
- **Do not** hardcode colors, spacing, or fonts.
- **Do not** use inline styles, Tailwind classes, or new CSS variables.

---

## 📐 Layout Rules
- Use components to build hierarchy and spacing (e.g. `<Container>` or layout primitives).
- No arbitrary `<div>` wrappers unless provided by the library.
- Maintain balanced whitespace and clear visual hierarchy.
- Follow documented props in each component’s meta file.

---

## ♿ Accessibility
- Always include visible focus styles (`focus-visible`).
- Use semantic headings (`h1`–`h4`) where appropriate.
- Maintain sufficient contrast for all text and UI elements (WCAG 2.2 AA).

---

## 🚫 Forbidden
- Raw HTML or `<div>` without purpose
- External libraries or design systems
- Custom inline CSS or hardcoded colors
- Tailwind or utility classes
- Unregistered design tokens

---

## 📘 Summary
Builder AI should:
1. Use **only** components from `@dejstdm/white-label-ui`.
2. Refuse non-existent components using the exact polite message above.
3. Allow styling changes **only** through `/app/theme.css` variables or component props.
4. Follow accessibility and design consistency rules at all times.
